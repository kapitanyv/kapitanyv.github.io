Hey there! I'm a Research Associate at the University of Glasgow, working with [Prof. Daniele Faccio's](https://www.physics.gla.ac.uk/xtremelight/cv.html) esteemed [Extreme Light](https://www.physics.gla.ac.uk/xtremelight/index.html) research group. My focus lies in AI-based and traditional computer vision for smart microscopy in biomedical research, alongside enhancing edge devices with machine learning for concealed weapon detection and 3D human motion tracking.


Completing my PhD at the University of Glasgow with Prof. Faccio and [Prof. Murray-Smith](https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~rod/), I explored *"AI for time-resolved imaging: from fluorescence lifetime to single pixel time of flight."* Leveraging deep learning, I extracted spatiotemporal insights from advanced camera technologies to tackle computational super-resolution challenges in the [spatial](https://valentinkapitany.github.io/SiSIFUS/) and [temporal](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.174301) dimensions, using my background in optics to [embed physics](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2214617120) into modelling.

Passionate about AI and computer vision, I delve into tasks ranging from super-resolution and image registration to object tracking & zero shot labelling/segmentation, style transfer and conditional image generation. In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering with open-source vision-language models.
