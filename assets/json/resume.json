    "summary": "I specialise in both traditional and machine learning enabled computer vision for smart microscopy as a Research Associate at the University of Glasgow. In parallel, I've enhanced edge devices with AI, notably for concealed weapon detection in smart home security and 3D human motion tracking. In five years of data science, I've refined skills across the spectrum â€“ from developing and deploying data pipelines and ML models, to storytelling through compelling visual narratives. I excel at extracting vital insights from haystacks of data, aiming to mould a more efficient, sustainable, and healthier future.",
